        //bat.bing.com/bat.js what makes it possible to track goal events

        uetq is a global array to track events
        each time an event occurs, a log of that event is pushed onto the uetq array (this makes it trivial to see if events are being fired, see how many you expect to be fired then see what the length of uetq is, take the difference and that's how many goals are not working)
            If the goal exists within the bing ads UI then you can just monitor the changes to
            uetq to see if events are properly being loaded


        You can even define your own events by pushing things 
        such as 

        <button onclick="uetq.push({ 'ec':'Video', 'ea':'Play', 'el':'Product Demo', 'ev':'5' });">Play</button>
        */

    })(window, document, "script", "//bat.bing.com/bat.js", "uetq");
